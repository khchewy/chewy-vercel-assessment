Hi there,

Thanks for reaching out, great question!

You can redirect your users from the /blog path to https://example.com by configuring a redirect in your vercel.json file, see here. Here’s some example code from our documentation that may help you get started:

```ts
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/blog",
      "destination": "https://example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

Would you mind giving this a go?

Please let us know if this prompts any further questions or if there’s anything else we can do to help.

Kindly,
Chewy
