Hi there,

Thanks for your reply, I totally understand the frustration here and we’re here to help you resolve this as quickly as possible.

In order to do so, we do require a little more information about your implementation and the issue you’re encountering to help us dig into this efficiently. As such, would you mind clarifying about as much of the requested information as you can?

Here are our questions again, for convenience:
> Would you mind sending over a preview link to the github branch or repo where you're running into this issue along with any necessary steps we'd need to follow to reproduce the error? We'd be more than happy to take a look in order to reproduce and resolve this issue.

Please let us know if you might be able to get us that information. We’d love to get to the bottom of this as soon as possible.

Kindly,
Chewy
