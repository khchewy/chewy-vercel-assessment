Hi there,

Thanks for reaching out, we’re happy to help!

In order to prevent your project from being indexed by search engines, you’ll want to set the `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` HTTP header on your page.

Would you mind giving this a go? Please let us know if this prompts any further questions, we’ll be here to help.

Kindly, <br />
Chewy
