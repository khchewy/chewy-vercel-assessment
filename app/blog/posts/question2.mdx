I’d love to further develop my technical expertise, particularly my knowledge of front-end development, and to handle increasingly complicated/technical tickets or cases at work. I’ve recently moved from the Technical Support team to the Support Engineering team at Fullstory and I’ve enjoyed digging into more complex customer issues; scheduling calls whenever necessary to troubleshoot and gather information, and I would love to continue my growth in this area by becoming an expert in front-end development as well as to lead and participate in support team projects that help upskill and enable the rest of the support team as well.
