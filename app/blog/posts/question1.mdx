##Favourite:
**Act as a dedicated CSE for a handful of key customers to ensure their success using Vercel**
As an experienced support professional, one of the things that keeps me in support is the satisfaction of seeing a customer “get it” and to see them demonstrate their new-found knowledge as they grow in their familiarity and expertise with the platform. At Fullstory, I enjoy the opportunities to work with our returning customers and to see them further develop their skills along their journey with us. As a dedicated CSE at Vercel, I would value the chance to see key customers grow and to grow with them, developing a sense of trust and rapport between those users and support.

**Help train and onboard new support teammates**
For similar reasons, helping to train and onboard new supporters is also one of my favourite support tasks. Not only do I get to dive into internal processes, support tooling, and common customer scenarios with a new teammate and see them learn and grow, but I also get the chance to spend some quality time getting to know them; their preferences, strengths, and who they are. I’ve had the pleasure of helping onboard a few APAC and west coast US teammates at Fullstory, including Justin; whom I had the privilege of getting to know as we ramped up together back in 2022.

**Write and maintain support articles and docs pages**
I firmly believe that documentation is one of the most important things for a support team to be doing in order to solidify its own knowledge base to serve as a resource within support as well as for other teams. Not only do I feel a great sense of satisfaction in putting pen to paper (so to speak), but I also enjoy diving in to develop a complete understanding of platform features and support processes, before translating my understanding into an approachable, concise, and clear resource to help enable my team; all of which I take great pleasure in as a co-owner of Fullstory’s internal support wiki.

**Work with the product team to develop a new feature based on feedback from customers**
I value and welcome chances to work with product and engineering teams, particularly when it comes to advocating on behalf of a customer. As such, working with product to build a new feature that addresses a customer need is one of my favourite support tasks; one that I feel has a very tangible impact for the customers who have been kind enough to share their feedback with us.

**Work with 3rd party partners to track down a tricky situation for a joint customer**
If there’s one way that comes to my mind for making a successful troubleshooting session more satisfying, it would be doing so in collaboration with others. At Fullstory, I’ve worked with some of our various partners on customer queries; be they implementation or investigating a confusing problem, and I’ve enjoyed learning from their expertise and comparing their findings with our own, so that we can each narrow down potential causes and solutions from our respective perspectives to arrive at a clear and accurate answer for a common customer.

##Least favourite:
**Respond to queries on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News and other 3rd party sites**
Due to its very public nature, and the importance of representing the company well, I’ve found social media tickets to be a satisfying but somewhat stressful aspect of support work. At times, I’ve also found that some social media queries are submitted by customers at the end of their patience, who have tweeted at the company account in a last-ditch attempt to rectify a dissatisfactory experience, so I’ve needed to invest a far greater amount of time into crafting a careful reply that aligns with the company as an official response, compared to other kinds of tickets. That said, I do enjoy the opportunity to openly uphold the company’s values in a public forum and to shout out our fantastic support team in directing social media queries to our help centre inbox.

**Engage multiple users at once in a public discussion, to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems**
Depending on the amount engagement occurring at once in a public discussion, I’ve found that it can play out in a number of ways. If there’s little-to-no engagement, then the discussion or workshop can be a little awkward. Conversely, if many of the participants are extremely engaged with discussion, it can be difficult to prioritise and adequately address each query in real-time. That said, setting appropriate expectations (as well as efficient tracking and follow-up for questions) can enable such an active discussion to be productive, or to hit the sweet spot, provided that users are prepared to have their more complex questions answered after the live discussion has ended.

**Help resolve billing issues for customers**
While billing support is absolutely essential and can lead to some quick wins for the support team, I’ve found that these kinds of tickets can often be monotonous or, at times, invoke a higher emotional toll as billing issues (such as unexpected charges) can lead to customers feeling wronged and coming at support red-hot and ready to pick a fight. For those reasons, while I have enjoyed working in billing support in the past and helping customers with refunds, credits, and plan adjustments, it’s also one of my least favourite aspects of support.

**Work with engineering teams during incidents and provide updates to internal and external stakeholders**
Incident management is a crucial part of working in support, and communicating between engineers and stakeholders presents significant opportunities for improving customer trust in the company; by communicating relevant updates with clarity and timeliness whenever new information about an incident becomes available. That said, incidents are typically a stressful time so they rank among my less favourite tasks in support work.

**Analyze hundreds of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use**
I would love to learn more about supporting the team with in-depth analytics to identify trends and signals to inform product strategy, as well as other signals relevant to support; such as staffing, however this is not something I currently consider myself an expert in, so I don’t hold a huge amount of confidence in running these analyses on my own. I would gladly welcome opportunities to shadow a more experienced supporter in building out reports and analytics to develop my own understanding.
