title: 'Imagine a customer writes in requesting help with a build issue on a framework or technology that you've not seen before. How would you begin troubleshooting this and what questions would you ask the customer to understand the situation better?'
question: 'Question 5'
publishedAt: '2024-04-09'
summary: 'Test'

Since I’m unfamiliar with the framework or technology being addressed in the customer’s query, I’ll start by quickly reading some general documentation for the framework/technology in question to get a better idea of how it works with Vercel (provided that the customer has identified what they’re working with, of course). Otherwise if it isn’t clear from the initial request what framework/technology the customer is using, I’ll make sure to ask the customer to clarify in my first response.

As part of my first response, I’ll ask for further details about their implementation and the build issue they’re encountering; or, better yet, a preview/share link to the github repository and branch, along with any necessary steps to reproduce the build issue. Any further information here from the customer’s side will be essential in forming my understanding about the framework/software, how they’re using it, and what the issue is.

If the customer’s able to provide that information, I’ll dig into the relevant Vercel or third-party documentation, internal resources, and previous ticket examples to see if the build issue in question has been documented. I’ll also attempt to reproduce the issue in order to gather information (and ideally, a stacktrace) for further insight; particularly if I subsequently decide to ask for help from our engineering team.
