From my current impressions of Vercel customer support, I would assume that the most common problems brought to the support team by customers are related to implementation and build errors.

To help customers overcome common problems in the short-term, I’d encourage our support team to continue their excellent work while preparing for long-term initiatives by flagging common themes among support tickets. In order to aid in our categorisation efforts that will facilitate later analysis, I’d make sure that the appropriate tags and build error-related categories have been configured in our support platform and that support agents have been informed about the updated categories.

After gathering a collection of ticket examples over a longer period of time that are more indicative of trends in customer queries about implementation-related issues, I’d initiate the second phase of this support project; conducting our analysis of ticket data to identify the most common implementation questions and their solutions. Armed with this information, those solutions can then be collated for public documentation in our third phase of this project; publishing fixes for common build errors and answers for FAQs, which customers can access to self-serve support.

There also exists a powerful opportunity to engage users and present this documentation at the exact moment that they might need it by instrumenting monitoring and reporting for those common build errors. If a customer encounters one of those errors, we can surface an app cue or notification to point them toward the solution.

The success of this initiative can be measured by monitoring the occurrences of these errors and tracking the user’s path through our documentation to determine whether they were able to self-serve a solution. This long-term project has the potential to deflect a high number of implementation-related customer queries when those customers encounter a familiar build error, thus freeing up support resources to do other support work that helps drive the practice forward.
